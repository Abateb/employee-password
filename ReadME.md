# Project title

### Password Generator

<br/>

# Project description

### The GW coding bootcamp Challenge that was presented along with the dynamic magics behind javascript motivated me to do this code refactoring.

### The aim is to build a dynamic application that enables an employee to generate random password based on criteria they've selected. Deploy a codebase that follows accesibility standards so the site is optimzed for required purpose.

### I worked on this project after coming across it as an assignment.

### HTML structure has been modified.

### A stylesheet, html was provided as a finished article, main focus of project was Javascript, which was greatly applied.

### Upon clicking the Generate button , user will be provided with prompts for password criteria, starting from length of password prompt, option to include what type of characters in the password

### Doing this project I learned how to target the DOM using if functions and boolean values to determine function exectutions.
